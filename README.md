2. Update the `db.js` file or `.env` file with the following connection details:
   ```javascript
   const { Pool } = require("pg");

   const pool = new Pool({
     user: "your-database-username",
     host: "your-database-host.com",
     database: "your-database-name",
     password: "your-database-password",
     port: 5432, // or the port of your choice
   });

   module.exports = pool;
   ```
3. Run the project as usual.
